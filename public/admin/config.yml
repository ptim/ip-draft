  # By default, saving a post in the CMS interface will push a commit directly to the
  # publication branch specified in backend. However, you also have the option to enable the
  # Editorial Workflow, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts.
  # publish_mode: editorial_workflow

# the media_folder file path is relative to the project root
media_folder: static/assets
# the src attribute for uploaded media will begin with /assets.
# if public_folder is not set, Netlify CMS will default to the same value as media_folder,
# adding an opening / if one is not included.
# public_folder: "/assets"
